Notes on WY Wind Model
======================

The current plan is for WY to implement the following 6 (or 7) functions, and I will likely repackage at least some of them as methods of a single wy_wind_model class:
(1) wy_wind_trans_probs()
(2) wy_wind_realizations()
(3) wy_wind_forecasts()
(4) wy_wind_speed2power()
-- NOT INCLUDED: (5) wy_wind_build_model()
(6) wy_wind_date2pidx()
(7) wy_wind_pidx2date() (optional)

Notes on included data files
----------------------------

winddata_npcc.mat - wind speed data
    winddata - (26303 x 16) matrix of wind speeds in m/s corresponding to
        16 sites (ny1-ny9, ne1-ne7), 3 years (2004, 2005, 2006),
        beginning @ 2004-01-01 1:00 (1am), ending at 2006-12-31 23:00 (11pm)
        (8760 * 3 + 24 -1 = 26303)
model_npcc.mat - model for log10(wind_data + 1)
    model - struct with model parameters for 16 sites based on winddata_npcc.mat


Design of WY Wind functions
---------------------------

Note: A design goal is to keep the code and data strictly separate, that is, to make sure that none of the code is specific to the particular set of wind data that we are currently working with.

Common Notation / Data stuctures:
    np_all = total number of periods in raw wind data
    nw_all = total number of wind sites in raw data (16 for current data set)
    np = number of periods of interest (e.g. for planning horizon)
    nw = number of wind sites of interest
    npd = number of periods per day (typically 24, for hourly data)
    nb = number of bins used for wind model inputs for MOST
    ws_max = max wind speed in m/s (for conversion table)
    widx = (nw x 1) vector of indices of wind sites of interest
    pidx = scalar period index for raw historical wind data
    dt = 1 x 6 standard Matlab date vector (yr, mo, day, hr, min, sec),
        specifying a specific period in the raw historical wind data
        yr = 4-digit year
        mo = month-of-year (1-12)
        day = day-of-month (1-31)
        hr = hour-of-day (0-23)
        min = minute (0-59)
        sec = minute (0-59)
    wind_data = (np_all x nw_all) matrix of wind speeds (in m/s), corresponding
        to np_all periods, nw_all specific sites, a particular npd, and a
        starting dt (dt0)
    bins = bin specification, supplied as either:
        (1) number of bins (nb), or
        (2) (1 x nb-1) vector of bin boundaries (standard deviation
            coefficients), where initial -Inf and final +Inf are assumed,
            but not included
    model = struct with fields:
        ar1 = (nw_all x 1) vector of AR[1] coefficients for individual sites
        ols = (nw_all x 9) matrix of OLS estimation parameters for individual
            sites: [C CY SY1 CY2 SY2 CD1 SD1 CD2 SD2]
        var_wnr = (nw_all x nw_all) covariance matrix for individual sites
        ar1_total = scalar AR[1] coefficient for total wind
        ols_total = 1 x 9 vector of OLS estimation parameters for total wind
        var_wnr_total = variance for total wind

Functions
    (1) tp = wy_wind_trans_probs(model, np, bins)

    (2) wsr = wy_wind_realizations(model, widx, pidx0, np)
        wsr = wy_wind_realizations(wind_data, widx, pidx0, np)
        pidx0 = scalar period index of first period of horizon of interest
        wsr = (np x nw) matrix of wind speed realizations, units are consisten
            with those used by model or wind_data, respectively

        The 1st option generates the realizations from the model, the 2nd
        extracts them from the data.

    (3) wsf = wy_wind_forecasts(model, widx, pidx0, np, bins)
        pidx0 = scalar period index of first period of horizon of interest
        wsf = (np x nb x nw) 3D matrix of bin means of wind forecast, units
            are consistent with those used by model

    (4) wp = wy_wind_speed2power(ws, s2p)
        ws = 2-D or 3-D matrix of wind speeds in m/s
        s2p = (1 x (ws_max+1)) vector (to be used for all sites of interest) or
            (nw x (ws_max+1)) matrix of fractions (for nw individual sites),
            used as lookup table for converting wind speed to wind power, as
            fraction of installed capacity, where 1st and last cols correspond
            to wind speeds of 0 m/s and ws_max m/s, respectively
        wp = 2-D or 3-D matrix of available wind power outputs as
            fraction of installed capacity, dimensions correspond to ws

    NOT INCLUDED: (5) model = wy_wind_build_model(wind_data)

    (6) pidx = wy_wind_date2pidx(npd, dt0, dt)
        dt0 = 1 x 6 date vector of same format as dt, specifying initial period
            of raw historical data

    (7) dt = wy_wind_pidx2date(npd, dt0, pidx)


Object-oriented version
-----------------------
I expect to repackage the above functions into a single class, something like
the following:

wy_wind_model
    properties
        ar1_total - scalar
        ar1(nw) - 16 x 1 vector
    methods
        build_model(wind_data)
        save_model(file_name)
        load_model(file_name)

        tp = transition_probs(obj, np, bins)
        wsr = realizations(obj, widx, pidx0, np)
        wsr = realizations(obj, widx, pidx0, np, wind_data)
        wsf = forecasts(obj, widx, pidx0, np, bins)

The user could then do things like:

    m = wy_wind_model;
    m.build_model(wind_data);
    m.save(file_name);

    m = wy_wind_model;
    m.load_model(file_name);
    tp = m.transition_probs(np, bins);
    wsr = m.realizations(widx, pidx0, np);
    wsf = m.forecasts(widx, pidx0, np, bins);
